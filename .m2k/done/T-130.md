# T-130: Generate EPIC for each of these improvements.

**Epic:** EPIC-027

## Improvements List
1. Prioritisation on EPIC (P1, P2, P3, P4)
2. Refactoring: Since we have a copy of markdowns structure in dbs, we can use that as display instead of parsing file. We just need to ensure they are in sync.
3. Fix what is injected in new project
4. Light mode
5. Remove terminal
7. Claude Log viewer
8. Options to edit/remove EPIC
9. User able to complete an epic
10. Add multiple view mode for epic. Kanban view, list view.
11. Searchable epic list in the PRD mode. THe dropdown should have be searchable for better UX
