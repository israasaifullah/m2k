# T-128: Implement sync/backup logic

**Epic:** EPIC-023

## Description
Copy .m2k folder contents to backup location with project-unique folder structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sync creates `/backup-path/project-name/.m2k` structure
- All .m2k contents copied to backup location
- Existing backup overwritten with current state
- Sync operation provides success/failure feedback

## Technical Notes
- Create project folder if doesn't exist
- Copy all files/folders from source .m2k to destination
- Use recursive copy for nested directories
- Handle file permissions and timestamps

## Dependencies
- T-126
- T-127

## Testing
- Sync → verify all .m2k files copied correctly
- Re-sync → existing backup updated
- Nested folders → all content preserved
- Large .m2k folder → handles efficiently
