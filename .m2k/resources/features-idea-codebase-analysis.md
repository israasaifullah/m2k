# Result flow
Result Usage
1) Documentation: For knowledge base and make better coding/arch decision
2) Detection: For refactoring purpose

# There should be 2 report format
1) Documentation format
2) Detection format (where & what, suggestion to improve)

# Conversion to Epic and Tickets
3) Based on the detection results, write epics or tickets for fixing.
