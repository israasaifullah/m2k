# T-129: Empty m2k file

**Epic:** EPIC-026

## Description
- When we use the sync function, the app only create empty .m2k folder.
- When we use the sync function, the app create a duplicate folder instead of updating
the existing one

## Acceptance Criteria
- m2k folder that are created should not be empty
- m2k backup folder should have same content as the project folder
- If i am in projectA, and create a backup folder, `/backup-path/projectA/.m2k` and if I resync, it should not create another folder, it should just update the `/backup-path/projectA/.m2k`. 
The current behavior is it will create a duplicate `/backup-path/projectA-1/.m2k`
